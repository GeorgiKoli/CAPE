Description: 
    This package infers predictive networks between genetic variants and between
    genetic variants and phenotypes. It is specifically designed for use with the
    multi-allele mouse population known as the Diversity Outbred (DO) mice. It
    uses complementary information of pleiotropic gene variants across different
    phenotypes to resolve models of epistatic interactions between alleles. To
    do this, cape reparameterizes main effect and interaction coefficients from
    a pairwise variant regressions into directed influence parameters. These
    parameters describe how alleles each other, in terms of suppression and
    enhancement, as well as how gene variants influence phenotypes. In this
    framework, alleles originating from individual founders are selected for
    pairwise regressions based on their main effects on individual phenotypes.
    These alleles are then treated as independent genetic markers in the pairwise
    scans. The result is different founder alleles from the same locus may
    interact with each other in the form of intra-locus epistasis, or dominance.
    All of the final interactions are reported in terms of founder alleles at a
    given genomic location.
